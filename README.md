# Codewars repo for Javascript
I do a Codewars everyday to keep pushing myself to grow and learn. Once I have solved the problem myself, I study the alternate answers of best practices, most clever and interesting solutions from my fellow coders. My first answer will always be the most easy to follow. Lately I have been challenging myself to also give a one line answer on top of my version of best practices.
