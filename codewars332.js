Arithmetic progression
In your class, you have started lessons about arithmetic progression. Since you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function that will return the first n elements of the sequence with the given common difference d and first element a. Note that the difference may be zero!

The result should be a string of numbers, separated by comma and space.

Example
# first element: 1, difference: 2, how many: 5
arithmetic_sequence_elements(1, 2, 5) == "1, 3, 5, 7, 9"
Parameters or Edge Cases:
Return:
Examples:
    1, 2, 5 --> "1, 3, 5, 7, 9"
    1, 0, 5 --> "1, 1, 1, 1, 1"
    1, -3, 10 --> "1, -2, -5, -8, -11, -14, -17, -20, -23, -26"
    100, -10, 10 --> "100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10"

Pseudocode:

// My Answer
function arithmeticSequenceElements(a, d, n) {
	return "";
}
