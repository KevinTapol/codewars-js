// Greatest common divisor
/*
Find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution.

The inputs x and y are always greater or equal to 1, so the greatest common divisor will always be an integer that is also greater or equal to 1.
*/ 

// Parameters or Edge Cases:
/*
    inputs will be integers greater than or equal to 0
    inputs will never be empty or null
*/ 

// Return:
/*
    the greatest common divisor of both numbers
*/ 

// Examples:
/*
    30, 12 =>  6
    36, 12 => 12
     8,  9 =>  1
     1,  1 =>  1
*/ 

// Pseudocode:
/*
    // declare variables for min and max values named min_int and max_int
    // find the min value of the input integers and set it equal to a variable named min_int and max val as max_int
    // iterate from 1 to min_int
    // if min_int divided by current index has no remainder and max_int divided by the dividend of min_int and current index has no remainder then return min_int divided by the current index
*/

// best practices and most clever 
// using recursion based on euclidean algorithm
// The Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(A,B) is as follows: If A = 0 then GCD(A,B)=B, since the GCD(0,B)=B, and we can stop. If B = 0 then GCD(A,B)=A, since the GCD(A,0)=A, and we can stop. Write A in quotient remainder form (A = Bâ‹…Q + R)
function mygcd(x,y){
    return y == 0 ? x : mygcd(y, x % y)

// one liner of best practices and most clever
const mygcd = (a, b) => b ? mygcd(b, a % b) : a;

// while loop also using the same logic of euclidean algorithm
function mygcd(x, y) {
    while(y) var t = y, y = x % y, x = t;

// similar to my for loop but going backwards with i-function mygcd(x,y){
